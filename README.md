# Gameboy Algorithms Demo

Implementing classic algorithm demos on Gameboy.

This is more of an exercise in implementing algorithms. Currently we're using printf to display results to the Gameboy screen, but the goal is to implement a GUI for selecting and comparing the speed and space requirements of various searching and sorting algorithms.

To get started, you'll need to download the GBDK, and make sure the CC variable in the Makefile is set to the location of your GBDK lcc binary.
